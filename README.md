# Detect_Pneumonia_With_CNNs_COLAB

This project focuses on fine-tuning a CNN classifier using tensorflow in a google colab environment. Some techniques that are briefly discussed are: overfitting, regularization, hyperparameter tuning, data analysis, understanding GPU access.

The scope of the project is fairly basic and provides an initial understanding of building a project in a google colab environment.
